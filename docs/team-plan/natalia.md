# Natalia's Tasks (Size: L)

## Your Mission

You're building the authentication system - the foundation that lets users create accounts, log in, and access protected features. You're also managing all database migrations to keep the team's database healthy as everyone builds.

## Task Breakdown

### ✅ Task 1: Create User Profile Model

**Files:** `backend/users/models.py`

**What:** Define the database structure for user profiles (extending Django's built-in User model)

**Why:** Every social media app needs to store info about users - username, email, password, profile picture, bio, etc.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Profile model created (extends or relates to Django's User model)
- [ ] User has profile_picture field (optional image)
- [ ] User has bio field (optional text)
- [ ] Passwords are automatically hashed (Django handles this with built-in User)
- [ ] Model appears in Django admin

**Think about:**

- What's the difference between extending AbstractUser vs creating a Profile with OneToOne to User?
- Should every field be required, or can some be optional?
- How do you handle file uploads for profile pictures?

**Helpful Resources:** Django docs on extending the User model

---

### ✅ Task 2: Build Authentication Views & Serializers

**Files:** `backend/users/views.py`, `backend/users/serializers.py`

**What:** Create API endpoints for signup, login, and getting current user info

**Why:** Frontend needs to send credentials and receive JWT tokens to maintain logged-in state

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] POST /api/auth/signup/ creates new user and returns JWT token
- [ ] POST /api/auth/login/ validates credentials and returns JWT token
- [ ] GET /api/auth/me/ returns current user profile (authenticated only)
- [ ] UserSerializer includes id, username, email, profile_picture, bio
- [ ] Passwords are never exposed in API responses

**Think about:**

- How do you use Django REST Framework's token authentication?
- What fields should be required vs optional in signup?
- How do you validate email format?
- Should you allow duplicate usernames?

**Helpful Resources:** DRF authentication docs, simple JWT

---

### ✅ Task 3: Configure URL Routes

**Files:** `backend/users/urls.py`

**What:** Map URL patterns to your views

**Why:** Frontend needs to know where to send requests (/api/auth/login/, etc.)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] POST /api/auth/signup/ mapped to signup view
- [ ] POST /api/auth/login/ mapped to login view
- [ ] GET /api/auth/me/ mapped to current user view

**Think about:**

- Should you use ViewSets with routers or individual function-based views?
- What URL patterns make sense for auth?

---

### ✅ Task 4: Build AuthContext (Frontend State Management)

**Files:** `frontend/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`

**What:** Create React context that manages logged-in user state across the app

**Why:** Every component needs to know "who is logged in" without passing props everywhere

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Stores current user object (or null if logged out)
- [ ] Provides login(username, password) function
- [ ] Provides signup(userData) function
- [ ] Provides logout() function
- [ ] Stores JWT token in localStorage
- [ ] Automatically fetches current user on app load if token exists
- [ ] Clears user state on logout

**Think about:**

- Where should you store the JWT token? (localStorage, sessionStorage, memory?)
- What happens if the token expires?
- Should you fetch user data on every page load?

**Helpful Resources:** Look at PostsContext pattern (Colin), similar structure

---

### ✅ Task 5: Build Auth Service Layer

**Files:** `frontend/src/services/authService.js`

**What:** Functions that make HTTP calls to your auth API endpoints

**Why:** Separates API logic from React components (cleaner code)

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] signup(userData) calls POST /api/auth/signup/
- [ ] login(credentials) calls POST /api/auth/login/
- [ ] getCurrentUser() calls GET /api/auth/me/
- [ ] All functions return response data
- [ ] Errors are thrown (not swallowed)

**Think about:**

- Should this file handle the JWT token, or should AuthContext handle it?
- How do you attach the token to requests?

**Helpful Resources:** Uses apiClient.js (Tito builds this)

---

### ✅ Task 6: Build Login & Signup Pages

**Files:** `Login.jsx`, `Login.scss`, `Signup.jsx`, `Signup.scss`, `index.js` files

**What:** User-facing forms for authentication

**Why:** Users need a way to create accounts and log in

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Login form has username/email and password fields
- [ ] Signup form has username, email, password, and confirm password fields
- [ ] Forms call AuthContext.login() or AuthContext.signup()
- [ ] Show error messages if auth fails
- [ ] Redirect to /home on successful login/signup
- [ ] Link between Login and Signup pages
- [ ] Styled using Pablo's design system (glass-card, neon-glow mixins)

**Think about:**

- How do you prevent form submission from refreshing the page?
- Should you validate passwords match before sending to backend?
- What if the backend returns an error? How do you show it?

**Helpful Resources:** Pablo's design system in `src/styles/`

---

### ✅ Task 7: Build Protected Route Component

**Files:** `frontend/src/components/ui/ProtectedRoute.jsx`

**What:** Component that blocks unauthenticated users from accessing certain pages

**Why:** Home, Profile, Friends pages should only be accessible when logged in

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Checks if user is logged in (via AuthContext)
- [ ] If logged in, renders the child component/route
- [ ] If not logged in, redirects to /login
- [ ] Shows loading state while checking auth status

**Think about:**

- How do you wrap a route with this component?
- When should you check if user is logged in? (useEffect? immediately?)
- What if AuthContext is still loading user data?

**Helpful Resources:** React Router's Navigate component for redirects

---

### ✅ Task 8: Create Test User Management Command

**Files:** `backend/users/management/commands/create_test_user.py`

**What:** Django management command to create test users for development

**Why:** Everyone needs test data to work with

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Command: `python manage.py create_test_user`
- [ ] Creates a user with username "testuser", password "password123"
- [ ] Creates profile with sample bio and placeholder avatar
- [ ] Doesn't crash if user already exists

**Think about:**

- How do you handle duplicate usernames gracefully?
- Should you create multiple test users?

---

### ✅ Task 9: Database Migrations

**Files:** `backend/users/migrations/0001_initial.py`

**What:** Auto-generated migration file that creates User/Profile tables in database

**Why:** Django needs these to know how to build the database schema

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- [ ] Run `python manage.py makemigrations` after creating models
- [ ] Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply migrations
- [ ] Verify tables exist in database

**Special Responsibility:** You'll also review and run Colin's and Crystal's migrations

---

## Integration Points

**You provide:**

- Auth API endpoints that return JWT tokens
- AuthContext that other components use via useAuth() hook
- ProtectedRoute that wraps authenticated pages
- User model structure with profile data that others reference

**User data format expected by Pablo's UI:**

```javascript
{
  id: number,
  username: string,
  email: string,
  first_name: string,
  last_name: string,
  profile: {
    id: number,
    bio: string,
    avatar: string | null,  // profile picture URL
    location: string,
    website: string
  }
}
```

**Profile Timeline Integration (Jan 2026):**

Pablo's Profile page uses user data to:

1. Display ProfileCard with flip animation (front/back)
2. Filter posts in TimelineRiver (timeline mode shows user's own posts)
3. Group friends' posts in Feed mode (each friend gets their own row)
4. Navigate between profiles (clicking avatar goes to `/profile/:username`)

⚠️ **Ensure `first_name + last_name` are available for display names!**

**You consume:**

- apiClient.js (Tito) - provides axios instance with JWT handling
- Pablo's design system - use for Login/Signup styling

**Work with:**

- **Tito:** He builds apiClient that your authService uses
- **Colin:** His posts reference your User model (author field)
- **Crystal:** Her friends reference your User model (friend relationships)
- **Pablo:** His UI expects specific user data shape from AuthContext

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Can create new user via /api/auth/signup/
- [ ] Can login with correct credentials
- [ ] Cannot login with wrong password
- [ ] Token is stored in localStorage after login
- [ ] Refresh page - still logged in (token persists)
- [ ] Logout clears token and redirects to /login
- [ ] ProtectedRoute blocks access to /home when logged out
- [ ] ProtectedRoute allows access to /home when logged in
- [ ] Profile picture uploads work (if implemented)

---

## 🚀 Stretch Goals (If You Finish Early)

These are **optional** but great for learning and portfolio building!

### Stretch 1: Password Reset Flow

**Backend:**

- Add `POST /api/auth/forgot-password/` endpoint
- Generate reset token, store expiration time
- (Mock) send email with reset link

**Frontend:**

- Create ForgotPassword.jsx page
- Create ResetPassword.jsx page (with token from URL)
- Add "Forgot password?" link to Login page

**Why it's valuable:** Every production app needs this. Great interview talking point.

---

### Stretch 2: Profile Update Endpoint

**Backend:**

- Add `PATCH /api/auth/me/` to update current user's profile
- Support updating bio, location, website, profile picture
- Validate file uploads (size, type)

**Frontend:**

- Add updateProfile() to AuthContext
- Wire up to Pablo's ProfileCard edit functionality

**Why it's valuable:** Demonstrates PATCH vs PUT, file uploads, partial updates.

---

### Stretch 3: Email Verification Flow

**Backend:**

- Generate verification token on signup
- Add `POST /api/auth/verify-email/` endpoint
- Mark user as verified in database

**Frontend:**

- Show "Check your email" message after signup
- Create VerifyEmail.jsx page

**Why it's valuable:** Production-ready auth requires this. Shows attention to security.

---

### Stretch 4: Become the PR Reviewer

Since auth is foundational, you understand data flow better than most:

- Review Colin's Posts PRs - check how he uses User as author
- Review Crystal's Friends PRs - check how she uses User for relationships
- Review Tito's apiClient PR - verify JWT token handling

**Why it's valuable:** Code review is a key senior developer skill. Shows leadership.

---

### Stretch 5: Write Auth Documentation

Create `docs/features-implemented/AuthenticationSystem.md`:

- Document all auth endpoints with request/response examples
- Explain JWT token flow (access + refresh)
- Show how useAuth() hook works
- Common troubleshooting (token expired, CORS issues)

**Why it's valuable:** Technical writing is underrated. Makes onboarding easier.

---

## 💡 Why Your Work Matters

**You're not just building login forms.** You're building:

1. **The trust layer** - Every request depends on your JWT tokens
2. **The identity system** - Colin's posts know WHO posted because of your User model
3. **The security boundary** - Your ProtectedRoute keeps the app safe
4. **The foundation** - If auth breaks, NOTHING works

When employers ask "What did you build?", you can say:

> "I built the authentication system from scratch - backend JWT auth with Django REST Framework, frontend state management with React Context, protected routes, and the user profile system that every other feature depends on."

That's a **strong** answer. 💪
